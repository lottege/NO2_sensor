## NO2 sensor
## DC motor
In this prototype we used a Jameco relia pro 253471. We started with a smaller 6V dc motor but it was not strong enough to rotate the bird. Therefore we switched to this stronger motor. Something remarkable about the use of the motor is that the motor itself is connected to the object, and the small pin is fixed. In this way the motor spins instead of the small pin coming out of the motor. 

## Power supply
The Jameco relia pro needs 12 V, this is why we needed a power supply that was strong enough. The adapter showed at the following picture is the one we used for this prototype. It's the SYS1308-2412-W2E of the brand Sunny.

In this case, it would be a better fit to have a wireless power supply, since the object rotates, and to be placed more easily.
