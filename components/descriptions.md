## NO2 sensor
## DC motor
In this prototype we used a Jameco relia pro 253471. We started with a smaller 6V dc motor but it was not strong enough to rotate the bird. Therefore we switched to this stronger motor. 
The Jameco relia pro needs 12 V, this is why we needed a power supply that was strong enough. The adapter showed at the following picture is the one we used for this prototype. It's the SYS1308-2412-W2E of the brand Sunny.
