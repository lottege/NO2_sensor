# NO2_sensor
This bird senses NO2 and according on the percentage NO2 it rotates around its axis. 

The housing of the NO2 sensor has the shape of a bird. A DC motor attached to the sensor enables the object to rotate. This rotation gives minimalistic feedback on the sensor's data. When the quality of the air is good, the bird is in it's normal position. But when the air quality deteriorates, the bird turns half a circle and lies down on its back, as if itâ€™s dead. In this way, by adding a small mechanism to the sensor, passers-by can immediately retrieve feedback from the sensor.
